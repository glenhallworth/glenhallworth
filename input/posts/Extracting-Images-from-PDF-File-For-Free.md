Had this problem a while back when I needed a logo SVG in a PDF brand guidelines document. I ended up asking one of the UX designers who had a Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. This is how to extract it for free on your own.

1. Install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)
2. Open the PDF file and select the page the image is on
3. Select the image and copy
4. Open a new Inkscape page, paste the image
5. Edit -> Resize Page to Select or Shift + Ctrl + R
6. Save (dat money)
